### The negative impact of the attack
# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers

# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers
Due to the long duration of time that this hack was left undetected it allowed the previously mentioned attackers known

as Nobelium to steal data for 14 months from more than eighteen thousand organisations. This complete breach of GDPR 
# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers
then grew exponentially due to the fact that the attack allowed Nobelium to see the inner workings of Orion's users,

Due to the large amount of time that the SolarWinds attack went uncovered, it is thought that thousands of customers

from thousands of organisations had there data stolen. The fact this went on for so long means that the attackers would
# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers
have been able to get far more data than if they were detected immediately and therefore for each customer there was

Due to the nature of this attack being to remain hidden and avoid suspicion, there is no evidence or reason to think
# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers
the attackers were planning to deny service as this would alert SolarWinds to the attack almost immediately.

### Who was attacked and when
# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers

# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers
SolarWinds is a software company who is most known for creating systems like 'Orion' which helps businesses to manage
# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers
their IT infrastructure.The SolarWinds attack was discovered in December of 2020. Unfortunately for SolarWinds, the 
# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers
attackers had gained access in September 2019, meaning their actions went undetected for 14 months. Nobelium, a

# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers

# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers
### The negative impact of the attack
# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers

# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers
Due to the long duration of time that this hack was left undetected it allowed the previously mentioned attackers known
# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers
as Nobelium to steal data for 14 months from more than eighteen thousand organisations. This complete breach of GDPR 
# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers
then grew exponentially due to the fact that the attack allowed Nobelium to see the inner workings of Orion's users, 
# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers
thus compromising those who used the user's systems.

### Categorisation via the STRIDE model

# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers
**Spoofing**:
# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers
This was one of the main reasons this attack was able to go on for so long. Due to the hackers installing
# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers
malicious code into the orion system they were able to create a backdoor. Nobelium were then able to utilise this by
# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers
gaining access to the organisations' systems and managed to impersonate users on these systems.
# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers

**Tampering**:

# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers
**Repudiation**:
# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers
It is evident that Nobelium was able to impersonate users within the orion's systems. This is evidence that they were
# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers
presumably able to mimic and/or deny transactions within systems, making them hidden.

# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers
**Information disclosure**:
# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers
Due to the large amount of time that the SolarWinds attack went uncovered, it is thought that thousands of customers
# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers
from thousands of organisations had there data stolen. The fact this went on for so long means that the attackers would

Two incidents were reported on the day of the attack. Around 8am, the cursor of one operator’s computer began moving unexpectedly. Around 1:30pm, this happened again, but the actor used the cursor to navigate to the SCADA system and attempted to increase the concentration of lye (sodium hydroxide) over one-hundred-fold from 100ppm (parts per million) to 11,100ppm[2], which is well over safe drinking allowances and potentially hazardous to human health.[3]

### The negative impact of the attack
# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers

# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers
Due to the long duration of time that this hack was left undetected it allowed the previously mentioned attackers known

The impact of the attack was minimal. While suspicious activity was noticed earlier in the day, the operator assumed it was the actions of a supervisor and no action was taken. Later, when the sodium hydroxide levels were changed, the activity was noticed by the operator and action was taken within minutes to correct the sodium hydroxide levels. Officials reported that no significant change was ever made to the water supply concentration and the attack presented no danger to the public at any time.[2][4]

### The negative impact of the attack
# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers

# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers
Due to the long duration of time that this hack was left undetected it allowed the previously mentioned attackers known
# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers
as Nobelium to steal data for 14 months from more than eighteen thousand organisations. This complete breach of GDPR 
# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers
then grew exponentially due to the fact that the attack allowed Nobelium to see the inner workings of Orion's users, 
# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers
thus compromising those who used the user's systems.

This was one of the main reasons this attack was able to go on for so long. Due to the hackers installing

malicious code into the orion system they were able to create a backdoor. Nobelium were then able to utilise this by

**Repudiation**:
# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers
It is evident that Nobelium was able to impersonate users within the orion's systems. This is evidence that they were

Due to the large amount of time that the SolarWinds attack went uncovered, it is thought that thousands of customers

from thousands of organisations had there data stolen. The fact this went on for so long means that the attackers would
# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers
have been able to get far more data than if they were detected immediately and therefore for each customer there was

**Denial of service**:

Due to the nature of this attack being to remain hidden and avoid suspicion, there is no evidence or reason to think

the attackers were planning to deny service as this would alert SolarWinds to the attack almost immediately.

**Elavation of privillege**:

### Who was attacked and when
# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers

# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers
SolarWinds is a software company who is most known for creating systems like 'Orion' which helps businesses to manage
# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers
their IT infrastructure.The SolarWinds attack was discovered in December of 2020. Unfortunately for SolarWinds, the 
# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers
attackers had gained access in September 2019, meaning their actions went undetected for 14 months. Nobelium, a

### The negative impact of the attack
# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers

# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers
Due to the long duration of time that this hack was left undetected it allowed the previously mentioned attackers known
# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers
as Nobelium to steal data for 14 months from more than eighteen thousand organisations. This complete breach of GDPR 
# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers
then grew exponentially due to the fact that the attack allowed Nobelium to see the inner workings of Orion's users,

**Spoofing**:
# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers
This was one of the main reasons this attack was able to go on for so long. Due to the hackers installing
# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers
malicious code into the orion system they were able to create a backdoor. Nobelium were then able to utilise this by

# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers
**Repudiation**:
# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers
It is evident that Nobelium was able to impersonate users within the orion's systems. This is evidence that they were

# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers
**Information disclosure**:
# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers
Due to the large amount of time that the SolarWinds attack went uncovered, it is thought that thousands of customers
# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers
from thousands of organisations had there data stolen. The fact this went on for so long means that the attackers would
# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers
have been able to get far more data than if they were detected immediately and therefore for each customer there was

# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers
**Denial of service**:

On 11th February 2021, just under a week after the attack, a Joint Cybersecurity Advisory was released by the FBI, the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center.[1] It summarised the incident as well as related potential security vulnerabilities, including the threat posed by using outdated operating systems such as Windows 7 which often no longer receive security updates, as well as techniques used by malicious actors with desktop sharing software like TeamViewer. As part of the report, the authors published a list of general security recommendations, as well as recommendations specific to water treatment facilities and users of TeamViewer software.

### Who was attacked and when
# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers

# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers
SolarWinds is a software company who is most known for creating systems like 'Orion' which helps businesses to manage
# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers
their IT infrastructure.The SolarWinds attack was discovered in December of 2020. Unfortunately for SolarWinds, the 
# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers
attackers had gained access in September 2019, meaning their actions went undetected for 14 months. Nobelium, a 
# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers
potential nation-state hacker group, were identified by microsoft as being responsible.
# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers

# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers
### The negative impact of the attack
# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers

# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers
Due to the long duration of time that this hack was left undetected it allowed the previously mentioned attackers known
# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers
as Nobelium to steal data for 14 months from more than eighteen thousand organisations. This complete breach of GDPR 
# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers
then grew exponentially due to the fact that the attack allowed Nobelium to see the inner workings of Orion's users, 
# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers
thus compromising those who used the user's systems.

**Spoofing**:
# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers
This was one of the main reasons this attack was able to go on for so long. Due to the hackers installing
# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers
malicious code into the orion system they were able to create a backdoor. Nobelium were then able to utilise this by
# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers
gaining access to the organisations' systems and managed to impersonate users on these systems.
# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers

# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers
**Tampering**:
# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers
Although the reason for this attack remains unkown it is EXTREMELY likely that database integrity was

# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers
**Repudiation**:
# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers
It is evident that Nobelium was able to impersonate users within the orion's systems. This is evidence that they were
# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers
presumably able to mimic and/or deny transactions within systems, making them hidden.

# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers
**Information disclosure**:
# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers
Due to the large amount of time that the SolarWinds attack went uncovered, it is thought that thousands of customers
# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers
from thousands of organisations had there data stolen. The fact this went on for so long means that the attackers would
# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers
have been able to get far more data than if they were detected immediately and therefore for each customer there was
# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers
most likely months worth of data stolen.
# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers

# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers
**Denial of service**:
# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers
Due to the nature of this attack being to remain hidden and avoid suspicion, there is no evidence or reason to think
# 2019 Capital One Cyber Attack - compromised the personal data of approximately 100 million customers
the attackers were planning to deny service as this would alert SolarWinds to the attack almost immediately.
